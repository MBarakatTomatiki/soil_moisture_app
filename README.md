### Description

The app gets its name from the _French word_ for `Thirst`. Its purpose, is to detect moisture content of soil from sensors.

Moisture was the main motif, but later it rolled to collecting ambient temperature, humidity and light too.

### API endpoints

The base URL for the application is `https://drip-io.herokuapp.com/`

The various endpoints are:

- ```/getdata/<currentdate in dd-mm-yyyy>```

- ```/getdata/now```

- ```/setthreshold```

- ```/getthreshold```

### Contributions:

We would love to see some feedback in the form of issues raised and PRs. If you need an `IoT` project with application integration, this project can serve as the baseline application. Show your appreciation by :star: ing and this repository.​ ​
